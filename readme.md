## About

This program tries to recover Armstrong's famous line from the Apollo 11 mission.  It creates populations of sine waves with random amplitudes, frequencies, and phases, and has them compete for the right to move to the next generation.  The fittest populations -- the ones that sound most like Armstrong -- get to survive.
